        <h1>The Rules of Blackjack</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Card Values:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.</li>
                    <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.</li>
                    <li>Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game begins with each player and the dealer receiving two cards.</li>
                    <li>Players' cards are dealt face up, while one of the dealer's cards is dealt face down (hole card).</li>
                    <li>Players take turns to decide whether to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).</li>
                    <li>Players can also choose to "double down" (double their initial bet and receive one additional card) or "split" (if they have a pair, split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet).</li>
                    <li>The dealer then reveals their hole card and must hit until their hand reaches 17 or higher.</li>
                    <li>If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they bust, and all remaining players win.</li>
                    <li>If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand with a total closest to 21 wins. In case of a tie (push), the player's bet is returned.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
